I wrote [this article](/articles/tools2/) earlier about my hackintosh development setup. Sometimes we're stuck on Windows for whatever reason, so this is how I setup my dev-environment when I have to use Windows. It's from the perspective of a developer who likes OSX and Linux, so it might not be your cup of tea, if you like how Windows works already.

## Install Stuff

Install all of these, first

* [git](https://git-scm.com/) and make sure "Use Git from Bash only" is selected when you install it.
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) I set it up [like on my hackintosh](/articles/tools2/)

## configuration

Right-click the taskbar and choose "Settings", check "Use small taskbar icons". There are lots of other options in there. I like the dark theme, under "Colors", for example.

I right-click stuff in the start menu and choose "Unpin from start menu" for everything, then drag the right-side of the start menu to make it smaller. I [disable Cortana](https://www.howtogeek.com/265027/how-to-disable-cortana-in-windows-10/) so I get a local-computer search, by default, but you'll have to reboot for it to take effect.

I generally remove all icons on taskbar except "File Manager", "Atom", "ConEmu" and "Chrome". You can manage what is stuck there by right-clicking and choosing "Pin to taskbar" or "Unpin from taskbar".

I end up with something that looks like this:

## ConEmu

[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) is a much better terminal emulator than CMD or MiniTTY, which comes with git-bash. If configured correctly, it looks pretty nice and makes working on Windows better.

This is how I set it up, but feel free to configure it however you like.

Right-click on the window-bar and choose "Settings":

* Under "Main" check "Anti-aliasing"
* Under "Startup" set "Specified named task" to `{Bash::Git bash}`
* Under "Colors" set the scheme to "Monokai"
* Under "Appearance", uncheck "Show search field in tab bar" and "Show buttons (toolbar) in tab bar"
* Under "Tab bar" set it to "Auto show" so you will have no tabs unless you open multiple tabs.
* Under "Transparency" check "Active window transparency" and set it to something slightly less than opaque
* Under "Status bar", uncheck "Show status bar"
* Under "Default term" check "Force ConEmu as default terminal for console applications"

Now, you should have something that looks like this:

## NodeJs

Hit Win-X and choose "Command Prompt (Admin)" If you're not in powershell, type `powershell`.

Type `npm i -g --add-python-to-path windows-build-tools` to install build tools that will make native node modules work. This adds python, a C compiler, and some other cool stuff, and gets it you all ready for node-development.
